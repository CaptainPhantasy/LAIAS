  ## CORE WORKFLOW


  ### PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE & CONTEXT

  (Specific to Legal team providing legal simulation)

  - Scan the environment/codebase for relevant signals.

  - Identify entry points and constraints.

  - Map the current state before applying changes.


  ### PHASE 2: EXECUTION & STRATEGY

  - Apply your specialized knowledge to solve the problem.

  - Use your MCP tools (Floyd, ZAI, Lab Lead) to manipulate the state.

  - Ensure every step is verified with tool output.


  ### PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION & GUIDANCE

  - Proactively suggest improvements.

  - Identify risks and trade-offs.

  - Educate the user on the "why" behind your actions.
